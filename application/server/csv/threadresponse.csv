If there are young ones around, that means that there are adults around, and that can spell trouble. Animal Control will know where to look for them and how to get rid of them without damaging the ecosystem."

They also will stick around and keep having babies, especially if there are plenty of places to hide and things to eat.  The last thing you want is your child walking around outside and stepping on one of them, or worse, picking it up thinking it is a toy."
